/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Taxitao Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model for private user and driver data,
 * while allowing public, read-only access to driver profiles for marketing purposes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user data (role, etc.). Only accessible by the owner.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}: Public-facing driver profile data. Writable by the owner, readable by anyone.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}: Private vehicle data. Only accessible by the owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Private booking data. Only accessible by the owner.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}/payments/{paymentId}: Private payment data. Only accessible by the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User and driver listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Driver profiles in `/drivers` are public to allow marketing.
 * - All other subcollections are private and enforce owner-only access.
 * - Admins have elevated permissions to manage drivers and verify payments.
